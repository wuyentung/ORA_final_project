# Efficiency Measure in Insurance Industry – A Network DEA Model
Kao and Hwang (2008) —the first study that applies Network-DEA to the insurance field, which consists of 24 non-life insurance firms in Taiwan between 2001 and 2002. Subsequently, several scholars use the same dataset in Kao and Hwang (2008) to test new Network-DEA models.
Efficiency decomposition in two-stage data envelopment analysis: An application to non-life insurance companies in Taiwan

When it comes to efficiency measure in insurance industry nowadays. It’s difficult to collect similar data since the change in financial statement over 15 years. 
Furthermore, network framework from Kao and Hwang (2008) should be update. 
We proposed a three stage network system which contains three processes, premium acquisition, reinsurance allocation and profit generation.
𝑋1: Insurance expenses
𝑋2: Operation expenses
        𝑋21: 50% of 𝑋2
        𝑋22: 50% of 𝑋2
𝑍^1,2: Premiums ceded to reinsurers 
𝑍^1,3: Premium income minus 𝑍^1,2
𝑍^2,3: Reinsurance premiums
𝑌1: Underwriting profit 
𝑌2: Investment profit
P1: premium acquisition
P2: reinsurance allocation 
P3: profit generation

Methodology - network DEA model
Multiplier variables
Technical efficiency lower than 0
arithmetic
for some arithmetic evidence
Contributions:
Use dummy process to deal with complicated network system, to handle arithmetic problem in network-DEA VRS model
Update network framework in insurance industry
Update insurance data sets from 2002 to 2019
Restrictions:
Efficiency decomposition in scale efficiency can still greater than 1 for some arithmetic evidence
Some final output was lower than one according to financial statement, there would be better way instead of adding all output of DMUs uniformly
We cannot tell the whole efficiency simply based on financial statement

Future work:
Use penal data to evaluate two dimensional efficiency decomposition in insurance industry
Trade off between underwriting profit and investment profit
IFRSs 17 would change the financial statement in insurance industry. It would be a chance to renew mod
